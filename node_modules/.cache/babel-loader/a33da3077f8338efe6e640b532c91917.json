Compared to the 200 the team used. In addition I had to find a way to compress the algorithim to using only 8 bits per card compared to the 16 used by the team. As using 16 would have required too much RAM.</p>\r\n      <p>It would have taken me a long time to figure out how exactly to format all these files in the appropriate way to be used by the AI bot during training, however fortunatly the open source version had some basic Abstraction file formats which I could use saving me a lot of time. </p>\r\n      \r\n      <p>Once I had created the necessary files for Abstraction it was on to promblem 2, Training.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Training</h2>\r\n      <h3>Nash Equilibrium</h3>\r\n      <p> As mentioned earlier it is unfeasable to compute a nash equilibrium for a 6 player game, however it could be approached using self play algorithims and Real time search during the game. </p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Blueprint Stratergy</h3>\r\n      <p>A blueprint strategy in poker AI is a pre-computed, approximate solution to the game that serves as a starting point for real-time decision-making. It's created by solving a simplified version of the game using abstraction techniques, providing a baseline plan that the AI can then adjust during actual gameplay to exploit opponents or adapt to specific situations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n      <h2>Key Features:</h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Capable of beating world's strongest players in 6-player poker</li>\r\n        <li>Trained and tested on an Amazon EC2 machine with 128 cores and 512GB of RAM</li>\r\n        <li>Implemented in Python</li>\r\n        <li>Utilizes advanced game theory and machine learning algorithms</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h2>Technical Details:</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The AI was developed using a combination of counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) and deep learning techniques. \r\n        It required extensive computational resources to train and optimize its strategy across the vast game tree of 6-player poker.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <Link to=\"/\">Back to Main Page</Link>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default PlaribusPokerAI;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,SAASC,IAAI,QAAQ,kBAAkB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAExC,SAASC,eAAeA,CAAA,EAAG;EACzB,oBACED,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;IAAAC,QAAA,gBAC3BH,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAiB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1BP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,GAAG,gVAIuG,eAAAH,OAAA;QAAGQ,IAAI,EAAC,4EAA4E;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAACC,GAAG,EAAC,qBAAqB;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAAI;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,qmCAAimC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEt1CP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA4H;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEnIP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA0sB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjtBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA8iB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAErjBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAW;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAAq3B;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC53BP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAkB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA0rC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEjsCP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAuB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChCP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA2mC;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAClnCP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAAwd;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC/dP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAAsR;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE7RP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAAyF;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEhGP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAQ;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACjBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAgB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA2L;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAElMP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAmB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5BP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAA6W;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAGpXP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAa;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtBP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,gBACEH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAA8D;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvEP,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAA2E;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpFP,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAqB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9BP,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAA6D;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACpE,CAAC,eACLP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;IAAkB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BP,OAAA;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;IAGH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJP,OAAA,CAACF,IAAI;MAACa,EAAE,EAAC,GAAG;MAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;IAAiB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OAClC,CAAC;AAEV;AAACK,EAAA,GAlDQX,eAAe;AAoDxB,eAAeA,eAAe;AAAC,IAAAW,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
