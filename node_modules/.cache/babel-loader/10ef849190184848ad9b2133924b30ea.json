Traditionally, AI strategies in two-player zero-sum games, like chess, are based on computing a Nash equilibrium, which guarantees that the AI won't lose no matter what the opponent does. However, in a game with more than two players, computing a Nash equilibrium becomes impractical because it's computationally infeasible and inefficient. As a result, Pluribus had to rely on different algorithmic approaches that allowed it to defeat human players without needing to compute exact Nash equilibria. The second breakthrough was achieving this with astonishing efficiency. Unlike previous AI projects, which required massive computational resources costing millions, Pluribus was trained in just eight days using a 64-core server with less than 512 GB of RAM and no GPUs. The entire training cost less than $150.
